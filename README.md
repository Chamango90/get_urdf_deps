# get_urdf_deps

Get a `.rosinstall` file with all (mesh) deps of an urdf. Example can be found in the `launch` file or in the [robot_recorder_tutorial](https://github.com/ipa-jfh/robot_recorder_tutorials).

This should simplify the process to create an 3d animation of ROS with the [recordit tool](https://github.com/ipa-jfh/robot_recorder) and [visualize it in the browser](https://github.com/ipa-jfh/urdf-animation).
